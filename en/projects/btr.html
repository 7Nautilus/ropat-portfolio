        <h2 class="hero-subtitle"><strong>Album cover design</strong> project for the <strong>BTR</strong> EP by French artist <strong>Maltezz</strong>.</h2>
        <p>The goal was to create a strong visual identity that aligns with the artist's musical universe.</p>
        <p>I worked on the graphic composition, color choices, and typography to reflect the energy and unique style of BTR.</p>
        <p>This project allowed me to develop my graphic design skills while exploring new creative techniques.</p>
