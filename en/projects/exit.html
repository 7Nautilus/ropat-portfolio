        <p>For this project, I based my work on an old Illustrator file from my friend @alxndr.rawz, in which he explored similar concepts by designing elements of the famous "exit" sign in his own style.</p>
        <p>I had this file on my hard drive for a while and wanted to explore it further. So I imported it into Photoshop, added my own graphic elements, and reworked the composition to give it new life.</p>
        <p>For the final rendering, I wanted to give this poster an oxidized copper look, with its green color and shiny reflections.</p>
